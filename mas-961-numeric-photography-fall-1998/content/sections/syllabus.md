Description
-----------

The creative use of scene-capture devices is explored in the context of computational expression. Students will each be equipped with a low-end digital camera and explore the physical environment for imagery that can bond well with computational post-processing, in the context of scene-capture, image-play, and interaction.

Intensive weekly exercises will be given, with review sessions each week.

Sponsors
--------

This course is sponsored with generous donations from Minolta and Interval Research Corporation.
